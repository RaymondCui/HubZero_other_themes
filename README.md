# Victoria University Laboratory

Joomla extensions (template and module) to customise HubZero, so it can be used as part of the Victoria University laboratory.

These extensions apply to HubZero version 1.3, which in turn is based on Joomla version 2.5.

## Template

This template is used for the entrance and other pages of the HubZero instance used by VU Labs.
The style (colour palette and fonts) follow the styling guide from Victoria University.
This template design is based of the hubbasic2013 template.

To use this template, git export the contents into a directory called vu_labs, or whatever, 
and then zip the directory and its contents into the file vu_labs.zip.

Use the Joomla administrator interface for extension management to upload and install the zip file.
Any previous versions need to be deleted first.
Then use the template manager to ensure the template is used as the default for the site.

See the instructions located in the docs folder to  modify this template for additional HubZero sites.

## Distribution

Packaged versions of the template and module
can be downloaded from the distribution directory.
