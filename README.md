# Alveo2015

A Joomla template to customise HubZero so it can be used as part of the Alveo Virtual laboratory.
This template applies to HubZero version 1.3 which in turn is based on Joomla version 2.5.

This template is used for the entrance and other pages of the HubZero instance used by Alveo.
The style follows the existing Alveo web site appearance at http://alveo.edu.au/.
The template was to be based on Twitter Bootstrap but this was not pursued.

To use this template, git export the contents into a directory called Alveo2015 
and then zip the directory and its contents into the file Alveo2015.zip.

Use the Joomla administrator interface for template management to upload and install the zip file.

See the instructions located in the docs folder to  modify this template for additional HubZero sites.
