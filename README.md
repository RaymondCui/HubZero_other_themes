# Alveo2015
A Joomla template to customise HubZero so it can be used as part of the Alveo Virtual laboratory.

This template is used for the entrance page of the HubZero instance used by Alveo.
The style is based on Twitter Bootstrap and follows the existing Alveo web site
appearance at http://alveo.edu.au/.

To use this template, git export the contents into a directory called Alveo2015 
and then zip the directory and its contents into the file Alveo2015.zip.

Use the Joomla administrator interface for template management to upload and install the zip file.
