Development Process
===================

Introduction: A summary of what was done and how to take it further.

The strategy here was to be as quick and dirty as possible.
The process is as follows:

1.  Copied current HubZero default style in file system using the command line. 
    The inbuilt template copy in the web GUI seems to be broken.
2.  Verified as working after forcing discovery.
3.  Downloaded by sftp.
4.  Zipped and reloaded/installed as a template via the web GUI.
5.  Debugged the process by adjusting the entries in the manifest file. Lots of stuff are broken here.
6.  When verified as working committed to github.
7.  Added an alveo.css style sheet to the template package with an entry in the manifest.
8.  Added to a line to load the css in the index.php
9.  Reloaded and reinstalled template after deleting previous attempts.
10. Added over-rides to the styles in main.css. Used the in-browser debugger 
    and the web GUI's facility for editing the css and php files in the template.

Committed to github when satisfied.

To build another:

1.  Checkout from GitHub.
2.  Rename alveo.css to correspond to new site name, say custom.css.
3.  Adjust Joomla manifest file with new file name.
4.  Replace old artwork with any new art artwork.
5.  Adjust Joomla manifest file to refer to new files.
6.  Export from GitHub and zip directory with new name.
7.  Install into HubZero test site and verify as working.
8.  Adjust custom.css in Joomla web admin GUI until satisfied.
9.  Copy and paste altered files back into working copy and commit.
10. Push into new GitHub repo.
